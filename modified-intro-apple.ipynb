    "**DSPy** emphasizes programming over prompting. It unifies techniques for **prompting** and **fine-tuning** LMs as well as improving them with **reasoning** and **tool/retrieval augmentation**, all expressed through a _minimalistic set of Pythonic operations that compose and learn_.\n",
    "\n",

On top of that, **DSPy** introduces an **automatic compiler that teaches LMs** how to conduct the declarative steps in your program. The **DSPy compiler** will internally _trace_ your program and then **craft high-quality prompts for large LMs (or train automatic finetunes for small LMs)** to teach them the steps of your task."
